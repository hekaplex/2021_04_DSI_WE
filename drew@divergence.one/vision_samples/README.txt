This capstone project is being conducted for the Divergence Academy Data Science Immersive Program - 202010 Weekend Cohort. 

Originally, I had planned investigate the consumer sentiment towards the Apple M1 chip through Social Media Analysis. 
This was a project that I had already completed, but through the use of R. I decided that as I have already completed that project,
and I'm alredady very comfortable with R programming, I would like to perform my project utilizing the tools/software
that I learned throughout this course. 

Now, I've decided to do my capstone project with more of a traditional machine learning lense. I found a dataset that contains 
information on the energy usage of appliances in a low energy home.
