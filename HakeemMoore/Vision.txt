Create a "Modern ML Data Warehouse" using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest unstructured datasets.
    * Data Factory allows you to easily extract, transform, and load (ETL) data. Once the data has been transformed and loaded into storage, it can be used to train your machine learning models in Azure Machine Learning(AML). Learn more about data ingestion with ADF at (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-data-ingest-adf).

    * Set up an Azure Data Lake Storage to contain clean data that will support Azure Synapse Analytics with DirectQuery to create real-time dynamic reports;
  Set up an Azure Databricks Workspace for preping and training Machine Learning Workspace; Implement Security and access control in Azure Machine Learning; 
    * Set up an Azure Data Lake Storage to contain clean data that will support Azure Synapse Analytics with DirectQuery to create real-time dynamic reports. Learn more here (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview).

    * Set up an Azure Databricks Workspace for preping and training Machine Learning Workspace; Implement Security and access control in Azure Machine Learning. An Azure Databricks workspace is an environment for accessing all of your Azure Databricks assets. The workspace organizes objects (notebooks, libraries, and experiments) into folders, and provides access to data and computational resources such as clusters and jobs.
